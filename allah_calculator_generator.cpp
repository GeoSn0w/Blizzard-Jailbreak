    "But when the forbidden months are past,
    then fight and slay the Pagans wherever ye find them,
    and seize them, beleaguer them, and lie in wait for them in every stratagem (of war);
    but if they repent, and establish regular prayers and practise regular charity, then open the way for them:
    for Allah is Oft-forgiving, Most Merciful."
